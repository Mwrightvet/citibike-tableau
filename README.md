# Citi Bike Analysis using Tableau

### Problem

[New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. Generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Datasets: Bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

## Task

**Design 2-5 visualizations.

**Answer the following Questions

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used ?

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?  

* What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

**Advanced Option**

* Design a dashboard with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. 

**City officials would also like to see one of the following visualizations:**

* **Basic:** A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* **Advanced:** A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year).  

* The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up unveiling any trends that were noticed during your analysis.
